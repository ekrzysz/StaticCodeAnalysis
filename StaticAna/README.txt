This program is static analysis done programmatically. 

The program creates a GUI which gives the user 3 components in the way 
of a textfield and 2 buttons, find folder and clone + run. The user is 
prompted to paste a github link of the project they wish to run static 
analysis on. Find folder allows the user to open their file explorer and
select a folder they wish to copy the github project to. Once both tasks
are done,the user should simply click clone and analyze to and the program
will clone the code from github to desired file folder and then on all 
the run static analysis. Once complete, the user will receive the results
in the folder which they cloned the project to. The file is an XML file
entitled "pmdResults".


Important: it is advisable to select an empty folder to copy the 
repository to, otherwise it can lead to undesirable results.
